### Date of Event: 12th October 2019.

### 🤔 What was your talk about?

I talked about some of the best practices for Voice User Interface Design. By working in voice-tech I learned and experienced some best practices which makes voice user interface much easy to use and which doesn't sound like a machine. 

### ✨ How did you get this opportunity?

I had applied to speak when CFP (Call For Proposal) was annouced. Based on my previous experiences, Organizers of GDG Ahmedabad selected me to deliver this talk.

It was 30 mins session.
